## Description

This project was made in order to expose us to taking old technology and converting it into something more modern. Along with this, it's also a lesson in the difference in databases and how two kinds can accomplish the same thing, it's just a matter of what is more convenient for the project's purpose.

## Installation

'npm i' followed by 'npm run install', then run 'npm run build' and 'npm run develop'. However, it can also be used through (link).

## Usage

The only part of the website that currently works is the login/signup function. Will revisit later.
